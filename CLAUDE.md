# CLAUDE.md

## Rules

1. **CLAUDE.md is not a general codebase document.** It exists to tell Claude how to start edit sessions and to correct against pathological mistakes. Only add to this file when something is genuinely needed to guide future Claude sessions—not for general documentation.

2. **Do not commit random markdown files or test scripts to GitHub.** While these may be useful during a session, they don't belong on the remote repo. Delete or gitignore them before pushing.
